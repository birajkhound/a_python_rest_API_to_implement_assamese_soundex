# a_python_rest_API_to_implement_assamese_soundex
Hello Folks! ‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶æ‡ß∞
I am Biraj Khound. I have done my masters in computer application from Jorhat Engineering College. During my masters i have done a web project named Assamese Dictionary under the supervision of Dr. Dhrubajyoti Baruah sir. This API is a part of that project. Here, we have implemented a function named assamese_soundex. 
To, know more about assamese soundex you can read this paper(href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/assamese_soundex/%22%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A7%B0%22") by Dr. Dhrubajyoti Baruah and to try out this API you need to follow the  /assamese_soundex/(the assamese word whose soundex is you are finding)  
Thank you,‡¶ß‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶¶ üòä
