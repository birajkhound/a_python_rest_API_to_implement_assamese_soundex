# a_python_rest_API_to_implement_assamese_soundex
Hello Folks! নমস্কাৰ
I am Biraj Khound. I have done my masters in computer application from Jorhat Engineering College. During my masters i have done a web project named Assamese Dictionary under the supervision of Dr. Dhrubajyoti Baruah sir. This API is a part of that project. Here, we have implemented a function named assamese_soundex. 
To, know more about assamese soundex you can read this paper(href="https://www.scribd.com/document/483575038/Design-and-Development-of-Soundex-for-Assamese-Lan") by Dr. Dhrubajyoti Baruah and to try out this API you need to follow the  /assamese_soundex/(the assamese word whose soundex is you are finding)  
Thank you,ধন্যবাদ 😊
